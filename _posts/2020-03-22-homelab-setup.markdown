# The Begining
So I have decided to finally start up a small little homelab. This is going to be something to keep me busy while forced to stay in my apartment due to the Coronavirus outbreak.
A Brief description of my current hardware:
* HP Z400 Workstation  
  * 12 G Ram  
  * Dual core   
* Raspberry Pi 2
* Raspberry PI B+

Most of this will be replaced as soon as possible, but for now it has to do. Eventually I would like to get a couple of small servers going to learn more about setting up clusters.
